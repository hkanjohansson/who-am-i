        <h3>Programming</h3>
        
        <p id="programming">
        My first experience when it comes to programming was that I started a little bit before university. At first it was all fun, but a few weeks in to the first course was when it got really messy. From then on and about two years ahead I just hated programming and all I cared about was math. 
            Then the summer before I started my third year as a mathematics, I started playing the game "Human Resource Machine" and got a good idea of the concepts of programming. After this I tested my newly aquired ideas on my old java assignments (which I barely passed at the first try) and it just felt natural. From then on I decided to fix my failed exam and the second course in Java.
