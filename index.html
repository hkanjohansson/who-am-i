                My name is Håkan and I am 30 years old. Currently I am studying on Linnaeus University in Växjö, Sweden. My first three years 
                I studied the Applied Mathematics program, but after I started to get the fundamentals of programming, I lean more and more towards 
                programming and Machine Learning.

                It has not always been clear to me what I wanted to do for a living. When I was about six years old, I started playing a mathematics game called "Chefrens Pyramid". Just a
                few years ago I found out that the game was for grade four to nine, so it was not that strange that it was hard for me. Anyhow I enjoyed playing it and taking small steps 
                forward every now and then. When starting elementary school, the math classes was way to easy and the school did not give me the next grade math, so I stopped enjoying it. 
                It was not until I decided to fix my grades, where I met a math teacher named Thomas, who was able wake my slumbered interest for mathematics again. Then I went on
                to do a "base year", where I studied the high school courses in mathematics and physics, and the interest for math just went up more.

                Before I started studying I was a truck driver for almost three years. Within five years from completely stopped driving, I had a bachelor degree in mathematics in my hands.

            My first experience when it comes to programming was that I started a little bit before university. At first it was all fun, but a few weeks in to the first course was when it got really messy. From then on and about two years ahead I just hated programming and all I cared about was math. 
            Then the summer before I started my third year as a mathematics student, I started playing the game "Human Resource Machine" and got a good idea of the concepts of programming. After this I tested my newly aquired ideas on my old java assignments (which I barely passed at the first try) and it just felt natural. From then on I decided to fix my failed exam and the second course in Java.

        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <!--Introductory text about programming goes here-->
        At first when I started the applied mathematics program, I looked forward to the two programming courses that was included in the program. Somewhere in my mind I have more
        or less always been interested in artificial intelligence, but since I did not do all to well in programming I did put that dream aside to become a pure mathematician. When I 
        finally started to really get hold of the concepts of programming, I decided to take a course in machine learning. 
        <h4>Connection to Mathematics</h4>
        One thing that came to my mind when I tried to explain summation operator to a friend studying calculus, was that it works more or less in the same way as a for loop. You define
        a starting point, an endpoint and eventually the step length in each iteration. To see whether or not a loop works, think of the concepts of the principle of induction. First you
        test one iteration and it works, then you assume that it works for all iterations and then it will probably work for one more. 
        <h4>Machine Learning</h4>
        The way I see it, if we take the best parts of mathematics and programming and put it in the same box, the result will be machine learning. Mathematics for the learning 
        of the models and programming to apply the knowledge aquired by mathematics.
